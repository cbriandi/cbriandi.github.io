## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, SCSS, JavaScript

I focused on making a simple yet good looking UI experience.

## Optimizations
In the future, I would like to expand the site into multiple pages, such as a projects page and resume page.

## Lessons Learned:

This project taught me a lot, not only about how to build/customize a site, but also how to use SEO. When I initially deployed this site, I had no clue how SEO worked. After my experience with this project, I now know how to use SEO to make websites show up when searched.
